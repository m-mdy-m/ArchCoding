### Basic Level: Getting Comfortable with Syntax and Basic Operations

1. **Hello, Variables!**
   - **Goal**: Define variables of different data types and print them.
   - **Instructions**: Create a variable for each of the following types (or closest available): integer, float, character, and string. Initialize them with values and print each one.
   - **Example Output**:
     ```
     Integer: 5
     Float: 3.14
     Character: A
     String: Hello, World!
     ```

2. **Simple Calculator**
   - **Goal**: Practice with arithmetic operators.
   - **Instructions**: Prompt the user to input two numbers, then perform and display the results of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on those numbers.
   - **Example Output**:
     ```
     Enter first number: 10
     Enter second number: 2
     10 + 2 = 12
     10 - 2 = 8
     10 * 2 = 20
     10 / 2 = 5
     ```

### Intermediate Level: Working with Conditional Statements and I/O

3. **Even or Odd?**
   - **Goal**: Use conditionals and operators.
   - **Instructions**: Write a program that checks if a number (user-inputted) is even or odd.
   - **Example Output**:
     ```
     Enter a number: 7
     7 is odd
     ```

4. **Grade Calculator**
   - **Goal**: Practice with if-else statements and relational operators.
   - **Instructions**: Write a program to calculate a student's letter grade based on a score input by the user. Use the following ranges:
     - `90-100`: A
     - `80-89`: B
     - `70-79`: C
     - `60-69`: D
     - `Below 60`: F
   - **Example Output**:
     ```
     Enter score: 85
     Grade: B
     ```

### Advanced Level: Implementing Loops and Nested Conditions

5. **Fibonacci Series Generator**
   - **Goal**: Implement loops.
   - **Instructions**: Write a program that asks for the number of Fibonacci sequence terms to generate, then prints that many terms.
   - **Example Output**:
     ```
     Enter number of terms: 5
     Fibonacci Series: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3
     ```

6. **Simple Interest Calculator**
   - **Goal**: Use mathematical expressions and floating-point arithmetic.
   - **Instructions**: Write a program that calculates the simple interest based on user inputs for the principal amount, rate of interest, and time period in years.
   - **Formula**: Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100
   - **Example Output**:
     ```
     Enter principal: 1000
     Enter rate of interest: 5
     Enter time (in years): 3
     Simple Interest: 150
     ```

### Expert Level: Multi-Component Programs and Complex Conditionals

7. **Prime Number Checker**
   - **Goal**: Use nested loops and conditionals.
   - **Instructions**: Write a program that checks if a user-inputted number is prime or not.
   - **Example Output**:
     ```
     Enter a number: 13
     13 is a prime number
     ```

8. **Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**
   - **Goal**: Implement logic and user interaction.
   - **Instructions**: Create a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game where the user plays against the computer. The computer's choice should be random, and the program should declare a winner.
   - **Example Output**:
     ```
     Enter choice (rock, paper, or scissors): rock
     Computer chose scissors
     You win!
     ```

9. **Basic Calculator with Error Handling**
   - **Goal**: Use conditionals and error handling.
   - **Instructions**: Enhance the “Simple Calculator” program to handle divide-by-zero errors. If a user tries to divide by zero, output a message instead of attempting the division.
   - **Example Output**:
     ```
     Enter first number: 10
     Enter second number: 0
     Division by zero is not allowed.
     ```

10. **Temperature Converter (Celsius to Fahrenheit and Vice Versa)**
    - **Goal**: Use expressions and modularize code.
    - **Instructions**: Write a program that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit based on user input. Let the user select the conversion direction (Celsius to Fahrenheit or Fahrenheit to Celsius).
    - **Formula**: 
      - Fahrenheit to Celsius: $C = (F - 32) \times \frac{5}{9}$
      - Celsius to Fahrenheit: $F = (C \times \frac{9}{5}) + 32$
    - **Example Output**:
      ```
      Enter temperature: 100
      Convert to (C)elsius or (F)ahrenheit? C
      100 Fahrenheit is 37.78 Celsius
      ```
