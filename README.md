# ArchCode

A companion to my personal learning journey through programming paradigms, CS theory, software engineering techniques, systems and hardware concepts, and more.

## About

This repository is where I collect and share everything important about:

- Programming paradigms (OO, Functional, Logic, etc.)
- Language concepts (type systems, metaprogramming, evaluation strategies)
- CS theory (automata, complexity, formal languages)
- Software engineering techniques (TDD, BDD, DDD, MBT, CI/CD)
- Systems & hardware fundamentals
- Handsâ€‘on exercises and project examples
